    <p>
      <strong>QR-Based Feedback System</strong> is an innovative digital initiative designed for college students to provide structured feedback on campus facilities such as <em>drinking water, restrooms, and the canteen</em>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This project was officially <strong style="color:#e63946;">Launched by the Hon’ble Minister for Higher Education, Dr. Govi. Cheziyaan</strong>, and has been successfully deployed at <strong>Anna University</strong> as part of a wider initiative to improve infrastructure transparency and responsiveness.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The opportunity to work on this project was made possible by the <strong>Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TNSCHE)</strong>, to whom I am sincerely grateful.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I had the privilege of working under the expert guidance of <strong>Dr. Ramesh</strong> and <strong>Dr. R.M. Chandrasekharan</strong>, whose mentorship was instrumental in the project’s success and in enhancing my technical capabilities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Through this experience, I acquired practical skills in <strong>PHP</strong> for backend development and <strong>Oracle Database</strong> for secure and scalable data storage, alongside frontend integration.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The system enables real-time feedback via QR code scans, featuring a user-friendly interface, categorized issue tracking, and administrative dashboards for effective facility monitoring and response.
